Tips Publisher Service
This service is a ZeroMQ Publisher that delivers random tips about video games. It runs on port 5556 and can be used by a ZeroMQ Subscriber to receive game-related tips. The tips cover both gameplay advice and library navigation guidance.

Features
Game Tips: Delivers random tips about gameplay and game library navigation.
ZeroMQ: Uses the ZeroMQ PUB/SUB messaging pattern for communication.
Dynamic Interaction: The subscriber can request a specified number of tips at a time.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pyzmq library for ZeroMQ
To install the required dependencies, you can run:

bash
Copy
pip install pyzmq
How to Run
1. Run the Publisher Service
In your terminal, navigate to the directory where tips.py is located and run:

bash
Copy
python tips.py
This will start the publisher service on port 5556, and it will continuously send random game tips.

2. Request Tips with a Subscriber
A ZeroMQ Subscriber (like the one we built earlier) can request a specific number of tips by sending a request to the publisher. The subscriber receives and displays the tips.

Example Subscriber:
python
Copy
import zmq

def request_tips():
    num_tips = int(input("Enter the number of tips you want: "))
    
    context = zmq.Context()
    socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)  # Use REQ for request
    
    socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5556")
    
    socket.send_string(str(num_tips))  # Send the number of tips
    
    response = socket.recv_string()  # Receive the response (tips)
    
    print("\nReceived tips:")
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    request_tips()
How It Works:
The subscriber asks for a certain number of tips (e.g., "How many tips do you want?").
The subscriber sends the request to the publisher via ZeroMQ.
The publisher sends back the requested number of random tips.
The subscriber receives and displays the tips.
Running the Subscriber:
To run the subscriber, execute the following:

bash
Copy
python subscriber.py
Example Interaction:
kotlin
Copy
Enter the number of tips you want: 3

Received tips:
In-person multiplayer gives you the best performance and connection stability.
